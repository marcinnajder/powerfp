* implementation of useful algebraic data types: `Option, Result, ResultS, Tree, List`
* utility functions used for function composition: `compose, pipe, curry`
* infrastructure for the implementation of functors, monads and applicative functors
* functors, monads and applicative functors implementation for algebraic data type (`Option, Result, ResultS, Tree, List`) and other frequently used types (`Array, Promise, Iterable, Observable, IO`)
* `do` Haskell notation using ES6 generators 
* code generators for algebraic data types and functors, monads and applicative functors
* utility functions like memoize and functions extracted from types like string, Regex (useful with function composition)
